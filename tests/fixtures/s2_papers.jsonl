The purpose of this study was to identify differentially expressed genes between the 2 groups. Expression profiles were generated from 6 human ovarian surface epithelia, 8 serous borderline ovarian tumors (SBOTs), 13 LG serous ovarian carcinomas, and 24 high-grade (HG) serous ovarian carcinomas. The anterior gradient homolog 3 (AGR3) gene was found to be highly upregulated in serous borderline ovarian tumors. This finding was validated by real-time quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. Anti-AGR3 immunohistochemistry was performed on an additional 56 LG and 103 HG tissues, and the results were correlated with clinical data. Expression profiling determined that 1254 genes were differentially expressed (P<0.005) among SBOT, LG, and HG tumors. SBOTs exhibited robust positive staining for AGR3, with a lower percentage of tumor cells stained in LG and HG. Immunofluorescence staining indicated that AGR3 expression was limited to ciliated cells. Tumor samples with a high percentage (>10%) of AGR3 positively stained tumor cells were associated with improved longer median survival in both the LG (P=0.013) and HG (P=0.008) serous ovarian carcinoma groups. The progression of SBOT to LG serous ovarian carcinoma may involve the dedifferentiation of ciliated cells. AGR3 could serve as a prognostic marker for survival in patients with LG and HG serous ovarian carcinomas.","inCitations":["1dd37126f74486107df7b16d81227744a0d88e50","7055983a10272d3f877cdac971dade75b530eb90","ae861e590adb53e39edf7bfc789faf4657cf4fb7","035541523125dd371c2e54bd0857bdefcc20fcd4","1c0569bdc00f5c94bca6d6ce1f0ff56ee166e186","3323a59e2d73c5d94815b319d1f5d253e5d07272","98cdd14c4a6e7caf0edcefc5261f5fece690fb82","3cf1fc5f34af504c2f7929808d5f4eecd83ce8a5","03d53f324a05fb42456153dce5030adc668b58cf","d9b5229159df105deb12abb89f9d3a4c13faedbf","74a4025efa8b72b6cb7264599635be23cd1b3064","d27c2651e9711c8c48dae29e78ed429d09d777c8","2facb4adaa52656bba0354a078744461bc20eafa","7b9bea7866a3c5eadba0eed535b1841d39ddb214","365a413840b28d8f6c3ac74d6a5145e61dc196a6","f011e402636d756b128e59db2988e9cab999647d","fa825e3dae82b525e1505482e52a8013a810915d","adfbdbc64eac001801c2965cac23123e182beb7f"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The anterior gradient homolog 3 (AGR3) gene is associated with differentiation and survival in ovarian cancer.","doi":"10.1097/PAS.0b013e318212ae22","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1097/PAS.0b013e318212ae22","venue":"The American journal of surgical pathology"}

A marked rise in CD3+ IEL occurred after challenge in the coeliac patients, peaking at 6 h and returning to normal by 48 h, with no significant changes in the gamma/delta TCR+ IEL. The IEL did not significantly change after gluten challenge in the controls. Acute gluten challenge induces infiltration of the rectal mucosa by T cells in coeliac patients, which is not accompanied acutely by increased numbers of gamma/delta TCR+ IEL.

Despite being usually restricted to cells of myeloid or monocytic origin, CD66 expression has also been reported in blasts from children with B-cell lineage acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL). An analysis of the CD66 expression was undertaken in a series of acute leukaemia patients. Antigenic expression was analysed using triple combinations of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in forty-five patients. The CD66 Kat4 fluorescein isothiocyanate clone was purchased from Dako (Glostrup, Denmark). CD66 was expressed in 2 of 29 patients with AML (acute myeloblastic leukemia) (6.8%) and in 8 of 12 patients with B-cell lineage ALL (66.7%; P <0.001); in blast crisis (BC) of chronic myelocytic leukaemia (CML), CD66 was expressed in two patients with lymphoid BC but not in the two with myeloid BC. The co-expression of CD66 with other myeloid antigens was observed in all CD66+ ALL/Ly-BC cases tested: CD 13 in six patients, CD33 in seven and CD117 in two patients. The CD66 expression is more frequent in ALL than in AML. Furthermore, we analysed minimal residual disease (MRD) in eight patients in complete remission. CD66 expression was associated with an abnormal B-cell differentiation pattern and with increases in CD34/CD19+ cells in all but one case. These findings suggest that an aberrant expression of CD66 could be used to investigate MRD in ALL. The association between CD66 reactivity and bcr-abl in adult ALL remains to be investigated.","inCitations":["b9ede2a6325ab3e00cc9c4eb5eadba0a0b885cc4","49dcdc950c12bde73cb328bdbe2760459e674995","174f85c1f9ce75c4439386ac819370cb3ebf33c4","8c1541ee8e426a6429b497f99ed4078641a402b7","f1dd7e6155ee01fbd64ca0737a3a4d51f68471a1","38dcf8baf17988a1caa244318cafb4f70af802a4","8671732a6e89514cd19023ab0306eb3261a81d8e"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"CD66 expression in acute leukaemia","doi":"10.1007/s002779900146","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s002779900146","venue":"Annals of Hematology"}

When the end-point for analysis used was death due to recurrent colorectal carcinoma and non-cancer deaths were censored, there was no difference in cancer-specific survival between transfused and non-transfused patients.

The CARDIoGRAMplusC4D Consortium reported 46 loci at genome-wide significance in an association analysis of as many as 64 000 cases and 131 000 controls, where the lead variants at these loci collectively explain 10.6% of CAD heritability. 2 In parallel, several studies have also focused on the genetic basis of known CAD risk factors, including circulating lipid levels, 3,4 hypertension, 5–7 type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), 8 body mass index (BMI), 9,10 and arterial calcification, 11–13 altogether pinpointing hundreds of loci across the genome. An important question now is to what extent the identified genetic variants overlap across traits and which biological mechanisms are shared. Background—Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is widely regarded as a cumulative lifetime measure of atherosclerosis, but it remains unclear what is the relationship between calcification and traditional risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD) and myocardial infarction (MI). This study characterizes the genetic architecture of CAC by evaluating the overall impact of common alleles associated with CAD/MI and its traditional risk factors. Methods and Results—On the basis of summary-association results from the CARDIoGRAMplusC4D study of CAD/MI, we calculated polygenic risk scores in 2599 participants of the Dutch and Belgian Lung Cancer Screening (NELSON) trial, in whom quantitative CAC levels (Agatston scores) were determined from chest computerized tomographic imaging data. The most significant polygenic model explained ≈14% of the observed CAC variance (P=1.6×10 –11), which points to a residual effect because of many as yet unknown loci that overlap between CAD/MI and CAC. In addition, we constructed risk scores based on published single-nucleotide polymorphism associations for traditional cardiovascular risk factors and tested these scores for association with CAC. We found nominally significant associations for genetic risk scores of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, total cholesterol, and body mass index, which were successfully replicated in 2182 individuals of the Heinz Nixdorf Recall Study. Conclusions—Pervasive polygenic sharing between CAC and CAD/MI suggests that a substantial fraction of the heritable risk for CAD/MI is mediated through arterial calcification. We also provide evidence that genetic variants associated with serum lipid levels and body mass index influence CAC levels. In this study, we focus on coronary artery calcification (CAC), a strong and independent risk factor for cardiovascu-lar events. To date, only 2 loci (CDKN2A/CDKN2B and PHACTR1) have been consistently …","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://circgenetics.ahajournals.org/content/circcvg/8/2/327.full.pdf?download=true"],"title":"Serum Lipid Levels , Body Mass Index , and Their Role in Coronary Artery Calcification","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

This retrospective study of women with positive culture for C. parapsilosis sought to characterize the significance of this finding and its response to antifungal therapy.\n\n\nMETHODS\nFrom February 2001 to August 2002, we identified all individuals with positive fungal isolates among a population of women with chronic vulvovaginal symptoms. Charts of women with C. parapsilosis cultures were reviewed with regard to patient demographics, clinical presentation and therapeutic response. Mycological cure, defined as a negative fungal culture at the next office visit, and clinical cure, i.e. symptom resolution, were determined for each subject.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 582 women had positive vaginal cultures for 635 isolates, of which 54 (8.5%) were C. parapsilosis. The charts of 51 subjects with C. parapsilosis were available for review and follow-up cultures and clinical information were available for 39 (76.5%). Microscopy was positive in 9 (17.6%).

An IVP is additionally carried out for the detection of concomitant upper urinary tract tumours. Preoperative urinary cytology is also performed, as in 10% of all patients the degree of malignancy of bladder cancer according to the TNM system is revealed more exactly by cytology than by histology. New computerized examination techniques have been designed in attempts to improve the accuracy of the diagnostic process. Therapeutic modalities according to the classification of bladder carcinoma in the TNM system have to be based on the different efficacies of the diagnostic procedure: In superficial low-grade tumours the diagnostic efficacy is quite high, so that transurethral resection remains the treatment of choice. Superficial high-grade tumours are attended by reduced 5-year survival rates, and patients with such tumours must therefore be regarded as a high-risk group. In muscle-invasive bladder carcinoma reduced diagnostic efficacy and unsatisfactory treatment results are seen, so that in this condition cystectomy at an early stage is indicated.","inCitations":["c7d0c10763c16a87dbf75aacc32b017d21cf4346"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"[TNM-oriented therapy planning in bladder cancer].","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Der Urologe.

Previous studies have described the anatomical structures underlying déjà vu in healthy subjects; however, the functional mechanism of déjà vu remains unclear. Therefore, this study investigated the brain structural and functional components underlying déjà vu by combining voxel-based morphometry analysis (VBM) with resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC). The VBM analysis revealed that the anterior parahippocampal gyrus (PHG) had significantly less grey matter volume (GMV) in high déjà vu group than low group, confirming previous studies. Further functional connectivity analysis revealed that the frequency of déjà vu experiences was negatively correlated with the strength of the rsFC between anterior dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and anterior PHG but positively correlated with the strength of the rsFC between posterior DLPFC and posterior PHG. Moreover, the frequency of déjà vu experiences was negatively correlated with the strength of the rsFC between the anterior and posterior regions of the PHG. These findings indicated that familiarity without recollection (PHG) and superior context monitoring (DLPFC) are critical for real-life déjà vu experiences.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Abnormal rsFC and GMV changes in parahippocampal and DLPFC for high Déjà vu experienced subjects.","doi":"10.1016/j.biopsycho.2018.02.001","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsycho.2018.02.001","venue":"Biological psychology"}

During winter months, leads expose the ocean to the cold atmosphere, resulting in supercooling and the formation of frazil ice crystals within the mixed layer. Here the authors investigate the role of frazil ice formation in leads on themass balance of the sea ice pack through the incorporation of a newmodule into the Los Alamos sea ice model (CICE). The frazil ice module considers an initial cooling of leads followed by a steady-state formation of uniformly distributed single size frazil ice crystals that precipitate to the ocean surface as grease ice. The grease ice is pushed against one of the lead edges by wind and water drag that the authors represent through a variable collection thickness for new sea ice. Simulations of the sea ice cover in the Arctic and Antarctic are performed and compared to a model that treats leads the same as the open ocean. The processes of ice formation in the new module slow down the refreezing of leads, resulting in a longer period of frazil ice production. The fraction of frazil-derived sea ice increases from 10% to 50%, corresponding better to observations. The new module has higher ice formation rates in areas of high ice concentration and thus has a greater impact withinmultiyear ice than it does in themarginal seas. The thickness of sea ice in the central Arctic increases by over 0.5m, whereas within the Antarctic it remains unchanged.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://centaur.reading.ac.uk/69908/1/Wilchinsky_Heorton_Feltham_Holland_2015.pdf"],"title":"Study of the Impact of Ice Formation in Leads upon the Sea Ice Pack Mass Balance Using a New Frazil and Grease Ice Parameterization","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

There is little evidence to support the use of antiseptic solutions in the prevention of infections at the surgical site.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAdditional clinical trials are necessary to provide evidence to support any of the methods for using topical antimicrobial agents to present surgical site infections. Dilute antiseptic agents should be considered in future trials when antimicrobial activity can be identified without local toxicity.","inCitations":["2a45b9617264b0e112fb5bda96a1bc1ab5d33771","37373fcc1c9667e15e0c1677b4bafc9798726204","13622f49d910b5bd3518d5c7c7e6cac0a1db02f8"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.7sbundle.com/uploads/4/6/4/2/4642325/fry_surg_infect_2016.pdf"],"title":"Topical Antimicrobials and the Open Surgical Wound.","doi":"10.1089/sur.2016.107","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1089/sur.2016.107","venue":"Surgical infections"}
